# GroupICA_EEGIFT
This repository contains some code on how to perform a group ICA using EEGIFT.

More information on this package can be found at http://mialab.mrn.org/software/eegift/
Download the software there, have a look at the documentation and do the demo.

I would have liked to upload some sample data for the scripts I've added, but those files were too large.
However, if you contact me, I can help you out with some demo data to run the scripts.
